Charts are now split over two pages: ICU and Population.

**ICU**:

* Reported beds in use by [LCPS.nu](https://LCPS.nu) has been added to the chart Beds used in ICU through [CoronaWatchNL](https://github.com/J535D165/CoronaWatchNL).
* In the chart Evolution of mortality rate in ICU the CFR is now calculated as a float instead of an integer.
* The number of patients moved from the ICU to a hospital bed is now reported by [Stichting-NICE.nl](https://Stichting-NICE.nl) and has been added to the chart Patients recovered vs. deceased.
* For all demographics charts [Stichting-NICE.nl](https://Stichting-NICE.nl) changed the format from percentage of patients to number of patients.
* Data that describes the demographics of patients moved from the ICU to a hospital bed was released by [Stichting-NICE.nl](https://Stichting-NICE.nl). A demographics chart was added to visualize this data.
* The chart Mortality displacement over the population of NL by weeknumber was moved to the Population page.

* A card was added that describes the total number of hospitalized COVID patients in the Netherlands as reported by the [RIVM](https://www.rivm.nl/coronavirus-covid-19) through [CoronaWatchNL](https://github.com/J535D165/CoronaWatchNL).

* A chart was added that describes the mortality displacement from [CBS](https://opendata.cbs.nl/statline/#/CBS/nl/dataset/70895ned/table?fromstatweb) vs. the number of deaths [RIVM](https://www.rivm.nl/coronavirus-covid-19/actueel). The mortality displacement is calculated from a 95% confidence interval over the last 10 years of data, excluding 2020. The RIVM data is collected through [CoronaWatchNL](https://github.com/J535D165/CoronaWatchNL).
* A chart was added that describes case counts (infected, hospitalized, deceased) on a day-by-day basis as reported by the [RIVM](https://www.rivm.nl/coronavirus-covid-19) through [CoronaWatchNL](https://github.com/J535D165/CoronaWatchNL).

* A chart was added that describes the cumulative number of tests done vs. cumulative number of positive tests as reported by the [RIVM](https://www.rivm.nl/coronavirus-covid-19) through [CoronaWatchNL](https://github.com/J535D165/CoronaWatchNL).
