v1:

* Charts are now split over two pages: ICU and Population
* ICU:
  * Reported beds in use by [LCPS.nu](https://LCPS.nu) has been added to the chart Beds used in ICU through [CoronaWatchNL](https://github.com/J535D165/CoronaWatchNL).
  * In the chart Evolution of mortality rate in ICU the CFR is now calculated as a float instead of an integer.
  * The number of patients moved from the ICU to a hospital bed is now reported by [Stichting-NICE.nl](https://Stichting-NICE.nl) and has been added to the chart Patients recovered vs. deceased.
  * For all demographics charts [Stichting-NICE.nl](https://Stichting-NICE.nl) changed the format from percentage of patients to number of patients.
  * Data that describes the demographics of patients moved from the ICU to a hospital bed was released by [Stichting-NICE.nl](https://Stichting-NICE.nl). A demographics chart was added to visualize this data.
  * The chart Mortality displacement over the population of NL by weeknumber was moved to the Population page.
* Population:
  * A card was added that describes the total number of tests completed in the Netherlands as reported by the [RIVM](https://www.rivm.nl/coronavirus-covid-19) through [CoronaWatchNL](https://github.com/J535D165/CoronaWatchNL).
  * A card was added that describes the total number of tests that came back positive in the Netherlands as reported by the [RIVM](https://www.rivm.nl/coronavirus-covid-19) through [CoronaWatchNL](https://github.com/J535D165/CoronaWatchNL).
  * A card was added that describes the total number of COVID infected in the Netherlands as reported by the [RIVM](https://www.rivm.nl/coronavirus-covid-19) through [CoronaWatchNL](https://github.com/J535D165/CoronaWatchNL).
  * A card was added that describes the total number of hospitalized COVID patients in the Netherlands as reported by the [RIVM](https://www.rivm.nl/coronavirus-covid-19) through [CoronaWatchNL](https://github.com/J535D165/CoronaWatchNL).
  * A card was added that describes the total number of deceased COVID patients in the Netherlands as reported by the [RIVM](https://www.rivm.nl/coronavirus-covid-19) through [CoronaWatchNL](https://github.com/J535D165/CoronaWatchNL).
  * The chart Mortality displacement over the population of NL by weeknumber was moved to this page.
  * A chart was added that describes the mortality displacement from [CBS](https://opendata.cbs.nl/statline/#/CBS/nl/dataset/70895ned/table?fromstatweb) vs. the number of deaths [RIVM](https://www.rivm.nl/coronavirus-covid-19/actueel). The mortality displacement is calculated from a 95% confidence interval over the last 10 years of data, excluding 2020. The RIVM data is collected through [CoronaWatchNL](https://github.com/J535D165/CoronaWatchNL).
  * A chart was added that describes case counts (infected, hospitalized, deceased) on a day-by-day basis as reported by the [RIVM](https://www.rivm.nl/coronavirus-covid-19) through [CoronaWatchNL](https://github.com/J535D165/CoronaWatchNL).
  * A chart was added that describes cumulative case counts (infected, hospitalized, deceased) as reported by the [RIVM](https://www.rivm.nl/coronavirus-covid-19) through [CoronaWatchNL](https://github.com/J535D165/CoronaWatchNL).
  * A chart was added that describes the number of tests done vs. number of positive tests on a day-by-day basis as reported by the [RIVM](https://www.rivm.nl/coronavirus-covid-19) through [CoronaWatchNL](https://github.com/J535D165/CoronaWatchNL).
  * A chart was added that describes the cumulative number of tests done vs. cumulative number of positive tests as reported by the [RIVM](https://www.rivm.nl/coronavirus-covid-19) through [CoronaWatchNL](https://github.com/J535D165/CoronaWatchNL).
