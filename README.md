# The Netherlands Covid ICU Analytics

All charts are generated using data from stichting NICE.

This repo contains the scripts and sources used for generating the dashboard on [sikerdebaard.nl](http://sikerdebaard.nl).

The RIVM data seems quite unreliable since data is not released in a machine-readable format. This data thus can't be added to this dashboard.
